# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of `crawly` is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse
backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the
consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to
recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not
be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer
as soon as possible.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the working group, contact the
project team at [info@ai-chat.it](mailto:info@ai-chat.it) with your appeal and the working group will review the
decision.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code
of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to
community business.
